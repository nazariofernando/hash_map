Hash Object using just primitives for KPCB Fellowship

This is a ruby code for a Hash/Dictionary Class just using primitives, for the KPCB Fellowship application

The Hash Map class has basic methods that simulates the main functions of a Hash object:

  - When you initialize a Hash Map, you need to give the size (pair key, value) of the object. For example, if you
  want to create an hash with two keys and two values, your size will be 2
  - The array method displays what is inside your hash function
  - The set method helps you to set a new key value pair and returns if the method was successful
  - The get method is for get a value given a key
  - The delete method deletes a kay, value pair given a key
  - The load method shows the size of the object
